Examples of automatic differentiation in pqR.  

The .r files can be run with pqR-2020-07-23, available at pqR-project.org.

Saved output from running them is in the corresponding .out and
possiblly .pdf files.  Note that output on different systems may be
slightly different, due to different accuracy of math functions.

Documentation on the automatic differentiation facilitities and the
facilities for arithmetic on lists (useful with autodiff) is available at
